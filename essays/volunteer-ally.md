    For Software Engineering II (ICS 414) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, I joined a group of five other students to develop a Meteor-based web app for the organization [Volunteer Ally](http://volunteerally.com) based in Hawaii. Volunteer Ally matches volunteers with nonprofits and organizations with a presence here, serving a similar function to websites such as [VolunteerMatch](https://www.volunteermatch.org). Minimum viable product to be delivered was a site where organizations could log in and post volunteer opportunites, which could be viewed by prospective volunteers. Volunteers could then create an account, contact the organization, and register for specific opportunities and track their completed hours on the site. We started with the Information and Computer Sciences department's Meteor/React template and built the application on GitHub using JavaScript. Over the course of the semester, I gained some valuable experience, and I'll be sharing what I learned in this essay.

## Client Specifications

    Since this was my first experience developing software for a client, one of the first lessons was how their needs and expectations evolve over time. They initially provided us with a simple Wordpress blog that emulated the base functionality they wanted to see. This template provided a skeleton for the layout and some basic graphics to get us started.
