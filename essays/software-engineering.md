Over the course of my formal education, I've learned many algorithms, techniques, and details. How to use Git, Vim, or Visual Studio. Functional programming, design patterns, coding standards. All of this is useful, sure, but it's also stuff I picked up myself pretty quickly as soon as I began to dabble in 

two or three of the following:
- Open Source Software Development
- Configuration Management
- Functional Programming
- Development Environments
- Coding Standards
- User Interface Frameworks
- Agile Project Management
- Design Patterns
- Ethics in Software Engineering
