summary: Simple 3D planet generator web app written in TypeScript using Babylon.js as a frontend.
---

Any random planet generator usually takes a top-down approach to designing geological features. But terrestrial planets and real-world features develop from simple laws carried out by nature. Emergent complexity. Tectonic plates shift and subduct, creating continents, mountain ranges, and seabeds. Oceans and mountains determine air currents and weather patterns, which in turn determine climates. From a single orbital photograph of earth, all of this is laid bare.

[Planetgen](http://connectiveunconscious.com/planetgen/) is my personal undertaking of emergent complexity applied to the generation of simulated terrestrial planets. While currently incomplete, it features randomly generated tectonic plates with faultlines on a subdivided icosahedron model with variable level of detail. Because it's developed in TypeScript, it can be run in any browser with WebGL support.
